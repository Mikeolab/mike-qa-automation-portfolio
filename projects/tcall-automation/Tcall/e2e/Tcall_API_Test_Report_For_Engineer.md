## ‚ùå FAILING TEST CATEGORIES

### 1. Senior QA Test Suite - 26 Failures

#### Agent Management Issues (500 Errors)
**Problem:** Agent creation, update, sync operations returning 500 server errors

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `POST /agents/api/` - Agent creation
- `PATCH /agents/api/{id}/` - Agent update  
- `POST /agents/api/{id}/sync/` - Agent sync
- `POST /agents/api/bulk_sync/` - Bulk sync

**Root Cause:** Server-side errors, likely missing required fields or validation issues
**Required Action:** Backend engineer needs to investigate 500 errors in agent operations

#### Campaign Management Issues (404 Errors)
**Problem:** Campaign endpoints returning 404 Not Found

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/campaigns/` - Campaign list
- `POST /api/campaigns/` - Campaign creation
- `GET /api/campaigns/{id}/` - Campaign retrieval

**Root Cause:** Campaign endpoints may not be implemented or have different paths
**Required Action:** Backend engineer needs to confirm correct campaign API paths

#### Phone Number Management Issues (400/404 Errors)
**Problem:** Phone number operations failing with validation or not found errors

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/phone-requests/` - Phone request creation (400 error)
- `POST /api/assign-phone-numbers/` - Phone assignment (404 error)

**Root Cause:** Missing required fields or incorrect endpoint paths
**Required Action:** Backend engineer needs to provide correct request body structure

#### Admin Settings Issues (500 Errors)
**Problem:** Admin settings operations returning 500 server errors

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/admin-settings/` - Admin settings list
- `GET /api/admin-settings/{id}/` - Admin settings retrieval

**Root Cause:** Server-side errors in admin settings operations
**Required Action:** Backend engineer needs to investigate admin settings API

**Problem:** External service endpoints returning 404 Not Found

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/twilio/` - Twilio status check
- `GET /api/retell/web-call-token/` - Web call token

**Root Cause:** External integration endpoints may not be implemented
**Required Action:** Backend engineer needs to confirm external integration endpoints

#### System Health Issues (403 Errors)
**Problem:** System health endpoint returning 403 Forbidden

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/health/` - System health check

**Root Cause:** Health endpoint may require different permissions
**Required Action:** Backend engineer needs to clarify health endpoint access

### 2. Performance Test Issue - 1 Failure
**Problem:** Business profile creation taking 8.9 seconds (expected <4 seconds)
**Impact:** Performance degradation in business profile operations
**Required Action:** Backend engineer needs to optimize business profile creation performance

---

## üîß BACKEND ENGINEER REQUIRED ACTIONS

### Critical Issues (500 Errors) - HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Investigate Agent API 500 errors** - Check server logs for agent creation/update/sync operations
2. **Fix Admin Settings 500 errors** - Review admin settings API implementation
3. **Optimize Business Profile Performance** - Profile creation taking too long

### API Endpoint Issues (404 Errors) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. **Confirm Campaign API paths** - Verify if `/api/campaigns/` is correct
2. **Verify External Integration endpoints** - Check Twilio and Retell endpoint paths
3. **Clarify Phone Assignment endpoint** - Confirm correct path for phone number assignment

### Request Body Issues (400 Errors) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. **Provide Phone Request body structure** - Current structure may be missing required fields
2. **Verify Call Log creation fields** - Some fields may be required but missing
3. **Check User creation requirements** - User creation may need additional fields

### Permission Issues (403 Errors) - LOW PRIORITY
1. **Review Health endpoint permissions** - May need different access level
2. **Check unauthorized access handling** - Should return 401, not 403

## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Prioritize 500 error fixes** - These indicate server-side issues that need immediate attention
2. **Confirm API endpoint paths** - Verify all 404 errors are due to incorrect paths
3. **Review request body requirements** - Ensure all required fields are documented

### Testing Improvements:
1. **Add more detailed error logging** - Capture actual error messages from failed requests
2. **Implement retry logic** - For transient 500 errors
3. **Add performance monitoring** - Track response times for optimization

### Documentation Updates:
1. **Update API documentation** - Include all required fields and correct endpoints
2. **Add error code documentation** - Explain what each error code means
3. **Provide example requests** - Working examples for each endpoint
