## üìã Summary
Implement AI-powered agent creation interface in Tcall dashboard using OpenAI integration, replacing business names display with intelligent agent creation prompts.

## üéØ Description

### Background
During team discussion, it was identified that the current Tcall dashboard interface shows business names, but there's a need to implement an AI-powered agent creation feature similar to modern product trends (e.g., Docker Desktop's AI features).

### Requirements

#### Core Feature
- **AI Agent Creation Interface**: Replace current business names display with an AI prompt interface
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverage existing OpenAI integration for intelligent agent creation
- **User Experience**: Implement conversational AI interface for agent creation

#### Technical Implementation
1. **UI Development Priority**: 
   - Build the user interface first (estimated completion: ASAP)
   - Integration work will follow (estimated completion: TBD)

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - Existing OpenAI integration
   - Cursor/Copilot assistance for rapid development
   - Current Tcall platform infrastructure

#### Subscription Model Integration
- **Enterprise Plan**: Full access to automatic agent creation feature
- **Basic Plan**: Limited functionality with upgrade prompts
- **Feature Gating**: Implement subscription-based feature access

### User Stories

#### As a Tcall User (Enterprise)
- I want to access the AI agent creation interface in my dashboard
- I want to type prompts to automatically create agents
- I want the AI to understand my requirements and generate appropriate agents

#### As a Tcall User (Basic)
- I want to see the AI agent creation feature but understand it requires upgrade
- I want clear upgrade prompts when I try to access premium features

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Phase 1: UI Implementation ‚úÖ
- [ ] Design and implement AI agent creation interface
- [ ] Replace business names display with AI prompt interface
- [ ] Create intuitive user experience for agent creation
- [ ] Implement responsive design for different screen sizes

#### Phase 2: AI Integration ‚è≥
- [ ] Integrate with existing OpenAI API
- [ ] Implement prompt processing and agent generation
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Test AI response accuracy and relevance

#### Phase 3: Subscription Integration ‚è≥
- [ ] Implement feature gating based on subscription plans
- [ ] Add upgrade prompts for basic users
- [ ] Create subscription-based access control
- [ ] Test subscription flow and feature access

#### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment ‚è≥
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of AI functionality
- [ ] Performance testing with OpenAI API
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Production deployment

### Technical Specifications

#### Frontend Requirements
- React/Vue.js component for AI interface
- Real-time prompt processing
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design implementation

#### Backend Requirements
- OpenAI API integration
- Prompt processing service
- Agent creation logic
- Subscription validation middleware

#### API Endpoints Needed
- `POST /api/ai/create-agent` - Agent creation endpoint
- `GET /api/subscription/features` - Feature access validation
- `POST /api/ai/validate-prompt` - Prompt validation

### Dependencies
- Existing OpenAI integration
- Current Tcall authentication system
- Subscription management system
- Dashboard infrastructure

### Risks & Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: OpenAI API rate limits and costs
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching and request optimization

- **Risk**: AI response quality and accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Add validation and user feedback mechanisms

#### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Feature complexity affecting user adoption
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple interface, iterate based on feedback

### Success Metrics
