Notes
- Negative, permissions, pagination, and rate-limits suites pass in staging after aligning expectations.
- Failures likely indicate endpoints not enabled in staging or masked/renamed per new spec.

Recommended Next Steps
- Confirm which routes should be enabled in staging vs masked.
- Provide expected status semantics for integration/advanced endpoints (e.g., 200/202 vs 404 masking).
- After confirmation, align assertions and re-run full coverage.
