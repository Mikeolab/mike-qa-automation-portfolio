## Security Assessment

### ‚úÖ Security Features Verified
- **Authentication Required:** All protected endpoints properly require valid tokens
- **Token Validation:** Invalid tokens are properly rejected with 401 status
- **Unauthorized Access:** Requests without tokens are properly blocked
- **Error Messages:** Security-related errors don't expose sensitive information

### üîí Security Recommendations
1. Consider implementing rate limiting for authentication endpoints
2. Review token expiration policies
3. Consider adding CORS headers for web client access

---

## Data Validation Results

### ‚úÖ Data Structure Validation
- **Pagination:** All list endpoints properly implement pagination with `count`, `results`, `next`, `previous`
- **Data Types:** All fields return expected data types
- **Required Fields:** All required fields are present in responses
- **Consistency:** Data structures are consistent across similar endpoints

### üìä Data Quality Metrics
- **Response Format:** 100% consistent JSON responses
- **Error Handling:** 100% proper error status codes
- **Data Integrity:** No data corruption or inconsistencies detected

---

## Issues Identified

### üî¥ Critical Issues
None identified.

### üü° Minor Issues
1. **Tenants Endpoint:** POST method not supported (405 error)
2. **Appointment Creation:** Endpoint times out during POST operations
3. **Missing Endpoints:** Some endpoints from Postman collection not available in current API

### üü¢ Recommendations
1. **API Documentation:** Consider updating API documentation to reflect current endpoint availability
2. **Performance Optimization:** Investigate appointment creation endpoint performance
3. **Endpoint Consistency:** Align available endpoints with Postman collection
